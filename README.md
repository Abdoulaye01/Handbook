# handBook
These are the 3 topics covered
● Coding standards in Java
● Unit testing in Java
● Version control: branching and merging strategy 
And each of the topics is on a separate branch expect the version control wwhich is on the master  branch  
beacause I wanted to demonstrate how to to merge a branch to the master branch that is why the master branch only has the version control you can switch to other examples by changing branches.

Thank You.
