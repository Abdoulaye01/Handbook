# handBook
These are the 3 topics covered
● Coding standards in Java
● Unit testing in Java
● Version control: branching and merging strategy and each of the topics is on a separate branch expect the version control which is on the master  branch  beacause I wanted to demonstrate how to merge a branch to the master branch that is why the master branch only has the version control you can switch to other examples by changing branches.

Thank You.
